# Programming-Toolbox
This is a repository for code snippets gathered from different sources which come in handy while working on IoT projects. It contains server &amp; client codes for communication between 2 WiFi modules (ESP8266 NodeMCU) over WiFi; and serial communication between Arduino and NodeMCU using both I2C and SPI Communication protocols.

> **Note**: None of the material used in this repository is my original. 
I wasted a lot of my time browsing the internet to find the right code for my purposes, and it was painstaking. So, I created this repository to avoid any hastle and nowI have a toolbox ready to be used any time I need it!
